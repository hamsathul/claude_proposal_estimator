## Duration Estimation Rules

When the RFP does not specify exact man-months for a role:

1. **Design phase roles**: Estimate based on project complexity and number of sections/lots
2. **Site supervision roles**: Match EPC contract duration (typically 18-30 months for water/power)
3. **HSE**: Usually full construction duration + warranty visits
4. **Planning**: Usually 70-80% of total project duration
5. **QA/QC and QS**: Usually 80% of construction duration
6. **Warranty**: Typically 25% utilization over warranty period (part-time visits)
